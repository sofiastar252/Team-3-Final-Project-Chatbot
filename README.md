# Team-3-Final-Project-Chatbot
Final Project. CPS4801 Spring 2025. This is Team 3. 
Team Members: Sofia Starinnova &amp; Chang Lu.
We recently spoke with you that Github doesn't support widgets (which we used to display our chatbot).
It says "Invalid Notebook" on Github, but if you download the ipynb file, all our code and output is still there.
Although Github doesn't support widgets, everything stills works (you just have to download the ipynb and open it on your laptop).
There are 2 Google Colabs for this (The Original Version &amp; Our Improved Model). 
Thank you!
